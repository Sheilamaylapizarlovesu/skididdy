      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        During Buwan ng Wika, I learned how important it is to value our own language and culture. 
        It made me realize how rich our Filipino heritage is. I can apply what I learned by speaking 
        Filipino with pride and respecting other people’s dialects. I was happy to participate and 
        support the performances and activities during the celebration. If I were to explain this to 
        a classmate, I would say that it’s a meaningful event that helps us remember who we are as Filipinos. 
        It’s important because it keeps our traditions alive and strengthens our unity as a nation.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        During the Intramurals, I learned the true value of teamwork and sportsmanship. 
        I realized that winning is not everything, it’s about playing fair and supporting one another. 
        I can apply this lesson in real life by working well with others and being respectful. 
        I participated by joining and cheering for my classmates, and it was really fun. 
        If I were to explain this to a classmate, I’d say it’s a sports event that builds stronger friendships. 
        It’s important because it encourages unity, school spirit, and healthy competition.

    <div class="reflection">
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Science Month taught me how science can change lives and open our minds to new ideas. 
        I learned to be more curious and observant of the world around me. 
        I can apply this knowledge by asking questions and learning more every day. 
        I joined and watched the exhibits, and I enjoyed discovering new things. 
        If I explain this to a classmate, I’d say it’s a celebration of innovation and learning. 
        It’s important because it inspires students to think creatively and value science in our daily lives.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        I learned that carbohydrates are an important source of energy that keep our bodies active and focused.
        Choosing healthy carbohydrates like whole grains and fruits helps provide lasting energy, while too much sugar can be harmful.
        This made me realize the importance of eating a balanced diet to stay healthy and energetic.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Teacher’s Day made me realize how much teachers do for us every day. 
        I learned to appreciate their hard work and dedication. 
        I can apply this by respecting and thanking them more often. 
        I participated in the celebration and helped make the day special for them. 
        If I explain this to a classmate, I’d say it’s a day to honor and show gratitude to our teachers. 
        It’s important because it reminds us to value education and those who guide us toward success.
